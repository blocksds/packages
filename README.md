# BlocksDS Packages

This repo contains build files for all the libraries shipped with BLocksDS. They
are automatically build and hosted as a pacman repository using Github actions.
They can be downloaded with the ``wf-pacman`` command.

## Installing libraries from the repository

Installing libraries from this repository can be done with ``wf-pacman`` like so:

```
wf-pacman -Sy library
```

Replace library with the library which should be installed.

An overview of libaries available can be viewed with:

```
wf-pacman -Ss
```

Installing all available libraries can be done with:

```
## WIP
wf-pacman -Sy
wf-pacman -S pspdev-default
```

Updating libraries can be done with:

```
wf-pacman -Syu
```

## Building individual libraries

Building a single package from a clone of this repository can be useful if you
wish to modify it in some way. It can be done by opening a terminal in the
directory of the chosen library and running the following:

```
wf-makepkg -i
```

This will build and install the package.

## Pacman Repository Hosting

The pacman repository created from this repo is published to GitHub Pages by the
GitHub Action in this repo. The repository should already be set up in
`wf-pacman` like this at the bottom of `/opt/wonderful/etc/pacman.conf`:

```
## WIP
[pspdev]
SigLevel = Optional TrustAll
Server = https://pspdev.github.io/psp-packages/
```

For forks or alternative repos, pspdev in the url in the `Server` setting should
be replaced with the owner of the fork. When forking, make sure to set the
GitHub Pages source to `GitHub Actions` in the settings of the GitHub repo.
